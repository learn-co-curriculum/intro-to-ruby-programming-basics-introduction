# Introduction to Programming: Ruby Basics

In this module, we're going to dive into working with Ruby from the very
beginning. You may be unsure about what a program actually is. By the end of
this module, however, you will be reading and editing programs, fixing errors
and creating a program from scratch.

We'll cover topics including

- What programs are
- File creation and editing
- Creating data in Ruby
- Storing and using data in Ruby
- Working with tests
- Reading and resolving errors

This module also introduces the concept of _labs_, lessons that contain tests
that can only be passed by writing code. This is to help ensure you are fully
equipped for the challenges ahead. The concepts we discuss in the following
lessons will be applicable throughout the remainder of your journey learning
Ruby.
